This code is a simple implementation of the 8-Puzzle solver using Depth-First Search (DFS) in Cpp code . The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with tiles numbered 1 through 8 and a blank space represented by 0. The goal is to move the tiles around to reach the solved configuration.
